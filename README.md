Crafting Academy Capstone project 1 - AI Assistant with a USB keyboard

Hardware used:
* TTGO Lilygo T-Display
* USB keyboard (brand XTime)
* Breadboard power supply (similar to https://www.amazon.com/Magic-shell-Breadboard-Battery-Assortment/dp/B07RVHQB1S)
* 9V battery and connector
* 2 x 10K resistors

Notes:
* This only works for my USB keyboard which is branded "XTime". It doesn't work with my wired Apple keyboard or my wired Microsoft keyboard. Other keyboards may or may not work.
* A breadboard power board is used to provide power for the keyboard. The voltage is set to 5V.
* 2 10K pullup resistors are needed for the inputs.
* The MySecrets.h file has to be modified with your network name, network password and OpenAI APIkey.
